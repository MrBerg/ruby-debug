This is really far from complete. Rather backup and sharing for the
case, someone would like to jump-in in this *very* early stage. A lot of
code is/might_be just wrong. Better to go away and return in few
days/weeks :)

Please contact me at martin.krauskopf@sun.com if you would like to
contribute, retake, send patches ... cooperate in whatever manner. See
the 'initiating' thread on the jruby@dev mailing list.
