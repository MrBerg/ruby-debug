= ruby-debug-base for JRuby

== Overview

(j)ruby-debug-base provides the fast debugger extension for JRuby interpreter.
It is the same as ruby-debug-base native C extension from ruby-debug project
(http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-debug/), but for JRuby.

== Install

(j)ruby-debug-base is available as a RubyGem. Unfortunately it is still not
installable remotely. But installation is easy enough:

- manually download the ruby-debug-base-0.10.0-java.gem to local directory from
  here: http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3085 

- install the Gem into your JRuby Gem repository:

   jruby -S gem install ruby-debug-base-0.10.0-java.gem

- now install ruby-debug with:

   jruby -S gem install --ignore-dependencies ruby-debug
