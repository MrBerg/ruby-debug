Current target is to get jruby-debug-base trunk compatible with ruby-debug-base
in version 0.10.1 running under JRuby trunk. When this is done we will
double-check support for latest stable JRuby release. We are sticking with
JRuby trunk since there are some bugs in currently latest release (JRuby 1.1.1)
and JRuby team is fixing bugs filed by us quite quickly.

== How to setup and run tests

0) checkout the sources (see README, section "Installation of trunk version")
1) apply patch from:
   http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=19779&group_id=1900&atid=7438
2) run 'rake prepare_tests'

You are ready to run all tests, e.g.:

$ jruby test/test-help.rb 
$ jruby --debug -S rake test_base
